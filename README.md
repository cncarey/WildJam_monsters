Godot Wild Jam #56 game submission

Monster Treasure Hunter is a collect-a-thon platformer which semi-randomly places collectibles to find. You play as the protagonist who travels to a far of island search of treasure. Along the way you must help the towns people to find the treasure. 

This is the first game I've made and the first game jam I've entered. I'm a single developer. The game doesn't have sound yet.
